# Wireless-Pi Tool Kit
# `FCAI-CU` Graduation Project
#### Inspired by [Wifi-Slax](https://www.wifislax.com/)  Project so We are going to create a distro that contains a lot of tools more than Wifislax tools and we will support ARM Architecture (e.g Raspberry-Pi). It comes with a lot of pre-installed drivers(e.g ALFA Network & Hak5 Products, etc.. ), software(SDR & Hak5 Products, etc..), package managers, and libraries (e.g pip, scapy, etc..). we are going to build  a tool (Red-Network Kit) that you can use to apply attacks on Network.
### more features are going to add in Raspberry-Pi Image `DMWAP`
`DMWAP` Stands For a Drone-Mounted Wireless Attack Platform that allows you to install Raspberry Pi (Wireless-Pi Tool Kit) on Drone to get access remotely.
