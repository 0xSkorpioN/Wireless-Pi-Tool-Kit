# Project Description <br />
### Inspired by [Wifi-Slax](https://www.wifislax.com/)  Project so We are going to create a distro that contains : - 
*  a lot of tools more than Wifislax tools and we will support ARM Architecture (e.g Raspberry-Pi).
*  It comes with a lot of pre-installed drivers(e.g ALFA Network & Hak5 Products, etc.. ), software(SDR & Hak5 Products, etc..), package managers, and libraries (e.g pip, scapy, etc..).
*  we are going to build  a our Tools (Red-Network Kit) that you can use to apply attacks on Network.

## Future Works

*  More features are going to add in Raspberry-Pi Image Like `DMWAP` Which Stands For a Drone-Mounted Wireless Attack Platform that allows you to install Raspberry Pi (Wireless-Pi Tool Kit) on The Drone to get access remotely.
* Creat WebSite For Distro.
* Creat Community For Distro.
* Containers Images (e.g Docker) .
* Live image on a CD/DVD/USB/PXE .
* Virtual Machines Images for [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) & [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) .
* More ARM Image `Pine64` `HardKernel` `FriendlyARM` `Banana Pi` `Gateworks` .
* Cloud Images (e.g AWS) .
* Mobile Image like Kali NetHunter Project .
* WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux is a software package on modern Windows installs that allow you to run Linux alongside your Windows system in an optimized container.
